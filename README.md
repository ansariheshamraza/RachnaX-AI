# 🧠 RachnaX AI – Structured Intelligence Workspace

## 🚀 Overview
RachnaX AI is a structured, multilingual AI workspace designed for Indian students, creators, and early-stage entrepreneurs. Unlike traditional open-ended prompt tools, RachnaX provides a guided creation system where users define intent, audience, tone, and language before generating content.

The platform transforms chaotic prompting into structured, purpose-driven intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Most AI tools rely on unstructured prompting, leading to:
- Inconsistent outputs
- Poor alignment with user intent
- Difficulty for non-technical users
- Weak multilingual accessibility

Users often struggle more with *writing prompts* than generating content.

---

## 💡 Solution

RachnaX introduces a structured intelligence layer on top of foundation models.

### Key Features:
- ✅ Guided Input Configuration (Intent, Tone, Audience)
- ✅ Optional Brainstorm / Reasoning Mode
- ✅ Multilingual Generation (English, Hindi, Marathi, Hinglish)
- ✅ Structured Output Formatting
- ✅ Secure Backend API Architecture
- ✅ Error Handling & Regeneration Control

Instead of “Ask AI anything,” we enable:
**Configure → Structure → Generate**

## 🏗 Current Progress

- ✅ Fully designed and deployed UI/UX
- ✅ Structured prompt builder implemented
- ✅ Multilingual input-output working
- ✅ Model routing logic designed
- ✅ Backend API integration completed (development-stage model)
- 🔄 AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku) integration pending credit activation
